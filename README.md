# Data Scientist | Data Analyst

## About Me
- An accomplished Data Scientist, I bring over three years of specialised experience, underscored by a Master of Data Science with Distinction from the University of Greenwich. Building strong relational databases and implementing advanced machine-learning models are two of my areas of expertise. I am skilled at turning complex datasets into useful insights using various cutting-edge technologies, including Python, SQL, Tableau, PowerBi, and Excel.
I'm seeking a position as a data analyst and I am excited to put my broad skill set to use guiding creative projects and navigating complex business obstacles. My dedication is to use data to inform strategic choices and produce observable outcomes.




## Projects
### Predicting Business Success Using Machine Learning and Data Analysis
- This project aims to develop a Machine Learning model that predicts the success of startups accros the world. The prediction is based on various features including total funding received, location, and funding rounds. The model was developed after an extensive review of existing literature discussing the factors influencing startup success and the role of Machine Learning in business predictions.
  
#### Data
  - The data for this project was collected from a public dataset on Kaggle. The "Big Start-up Success/Fail Dataset from Crunchbase" is a comprehensive database containing a variety of statistics about start-ups around the world. The dataset, which has 66,368 entries total across 14 variables, offers a wealth of information for study and analysis.
    
#### Methodology
- The project involved a series of steps:

#### Analysis and Visualisation
- In Order to better understand the dataset, Analysis where carried out on the data and here are some of the insights found

- 	VISUALISING THE NUMBER OF STARTUPS BY STATUS
The data discovery process started by visualising the number of start-ups arranged according to their status. This gives a basic idea of the dataset's organisation and the distribution of the various start-up statuses.

- 	VISUALISING THE NUMBER OF STARTUPS BY FUNDING ROUNDS
An important part of a start-upâ€™s life is the funding rounds. It was vital to determine how each firm had fared in terms of financing by visualising the distribution of start-ups according to their funding rounds.

- 	VISUALISING TOP COUNTRIES WITH MOST STARTUPS
Geographical distribution can reveal regional characteristics that affect the emergence and success of start-ups. the aim was to find such geographical patterns by visualising the top countries with the most start-ups.
