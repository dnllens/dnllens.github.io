# Projects
## Predicting Business Success Using Machine Learning and Data Analysis
- This project aims to develop a Machine Learning model that predicts the success of startups accros the world. The prediction is based on various features including total funding received, location, and funding rounds. The model was developed after an extensive review of existing literature discussing the factors influencing startup success and the role of Machine Learning in business predictions.
  
#### Data
  - The data for this project was collected from a public dataset on Kaggle. The "Big Start-up Success/Fail Dataset from Crunchbase" is a comprehensive database containing a variety of statistics about start-ups around the world. The dataset, which has 66,368 entries total across 14 variables, offers a wealth of information for study and analysis.
    
#### Methodology
- The project involved a series of steps:

  #### Result
  - The trained model was integrated into a user-friendly web application using Streamlit to help various stakeholders in making data-driven decisions, thus reducing the risks associated with startup investments and contributing to the growth of a successful startup ecosystem.



## 2016 Wind Industry Health and Safety Incident Analysis
- This project contains data, analysis scripts, and visualizations for health and safety incidents that occurred in the wind industry during 2016. The project's goal is to uncover patterns, understand risk factors, and enhance safety standards within the industry.

#### Data
- The dataset comprises recorded incidents from the wind industry in the year 2016, capturing various aspects such as incident type, severity, and outcomes.

#### Methodology
##### Data Preprocessing
- Tool Used: Python
- Description: Raw data was cleaned and preprocessed using Python to ensure consistency and prepare it for analysis. This involved handling missing values, standardizing date formats, and categorizing incidents.
##### Data Analysis
- Tool Used: SQL
- Description: Using SQL, the preprocessed data was analyzed to extract insights. The analysis focused on identifying incident trends, common types of incidents, and their potential for causing harm.
##### Data Visualization
- Tool Used: Power BI
- Description: Interactive dashboards and visualizations were created in Power BI, providing an intuitive representation of the analysis results.
